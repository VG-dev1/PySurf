Thank you for your interest in contributing to PySurf! We welcome contributions of all kinds, including bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code contributions.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/VG-dev1/PySurf/issues) page to avoid duplicates.
- Provide clear descriptions, steps to reproduce, and relevant screenshots or logs.

### Suggesting Features
- Open a new issue describing your idea and its benefits.
- Discuss with maintainers if needed before starting work.

### Submitting Code Contributions Using GitHub

You don’t need to use the command line — you can contribute using GitHub’s website interface by following these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**  
   - Go to the PySurf GitHub page.  
   - Click the **Fork** button at the top right. This creates your own copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Create a new branch**  
   - On your forked repo, click the **Branch** dropdown (usually says `main` by default).  
   - Type a new branch name (e.g., `feature-add-shortcut`) and press Enter.

3. **Make your changes**  
   - Navigate to the file you want to edit by browsing the repository.  
   - Click the **pencil icon** (Edit this file) to open the web editor.  
   - Make your changes directly in the browser.

4. **Commit your changes**  
   - Scroll down to the "Commit changes" section below the editor.  
   - Add a brief, clear commit message describing your change.  
   - Choose "Commit directly to `your-branch-name`".  
   - Click **Commit changes**.

5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**  
   - Go to the **Pull Requests** tab in your fork.  
   - Click **New pull request**.  
   - Ensure the base repository is `yourusername/pysurf` and the base branch is `main`.  
   - Confirm the head repository is your fork and the compare branch is your feature branch.  
   - Add a title and description for your PR explaining your changes.  
   - Click **Create pull request**.

6. **Review and update**  
   - Maintain the conversation on the PR page if reviewers request changes.  
   - To update your PR, just repeat the editing and committing steps on your branch — the PR updates automatically.
